This guide walks you through the process of creating a "`Hello, World`" RESTful web
service with Spring that includes headers for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in the
response. You can find more information about Spring CORS support in this
link:/blog/2015/06/08/cors-support-in-spring-framework[blog post].

== What You Will Build

You will build a service that accepts HTTP GET requests at
`http://localhost:8080/greeting` and responds with a JSON representation of a greeting, as
the following listing shows:

====
[source,json]
----
{"id":1,"content":"Hello, World!"}
----
====

You can customize the greeting with an optional `name` parameter in the query string, as
the following listing shows:

====
[source,text]
----
http://localhost:8080/greeting?name=User
----
====

The `name` parameter value overrides the default value of `World` and is reflected in the
response, as the following listing shows:

====
[source,json]
----
{"id":1,"content":"Hello, User!"}
----
====

This service differs slightly from the one described in
{gs-rest-service}[Building a RESTful Web Service], in that it uses Spring Framework CORS
support to add the relevant CORS response headers.

== Starting with Spring Initializr

For all Spring applications, you should start with the https://start.spring.io[Spring
Initializr]. The Initializr offers a fast way to pull in all the dependencies you need for
an application and does a lot of the setup for you. This example needs only the Spring Web
dependency.

The following listing shows the `pom.xml` file that is created when you choose Maven:

====
[source,xml]
----
include::initial/pom.xml[]
----
====

The following listing shows the `build.gradle` file that is created when you choose Gradle:

====
[source,text]
----
include::initial/build.gradle[]
----
====

=== Adding the `httpclient` Dependency

The tests (in
`complete/src/test/java/com/example/restservicecors/GreetingIntegrationTests.java`)
require the Apache `httpclient` library.

To add the Apache `httpclient` library to Maven, add the following dependency:

====
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.httpcomponents</groupId>
  <artifactId>httpclient</artifactId>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----
====

The following listing shows the finished `pom.xml` file:

====
[source,xml]
----
include::complete/pom.xml[]
----
====

To add the Apache `httpclient` library to Gradle, add the following dependency:

====
[source,text]
----
testImplementation 'org.apache.httpcomponents:httpclient'
----
====

The following listing shows the finished `build.gradle` file:

== Create a Resource Representation Class

Now that you have set up the project and build system, you can create your web service.

Begin the process by thinking about service interactions.

The service will handle `GET` requests to `/greeting`, optionally with a `name` parameter
in the query string. The `GET` request should return a `200 OK` response with JSON in the
body to represent a greeting. It should resemble the following listing:

====
[source,json]
----
{
    "id": 1,
    "content": "Hello, World!"
}
----
====

The `id` field is a unique identifier for the greeting, and `content` is the textual
representation of the greeting.

To model the greeting representation, create a resource representation class. Provide a
plain old Java object with fields, constructors, and accessors for the `id` and `content`
data, as the following listing (from
  `src/main/java/com/example/restservicecors/Greeting.java`) shows:

====
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/com/example/restservicecors/Greeting.java[]
----
====

NOTE: Spring uses the {jackson}[Jackson JSON] library to automatically marshal instances
of type `Greeting` into JSON.

== Create a Resource Controller

In Spring's approach to building RESTful web services, HTTP requests are handled by a
controller. These components are easily identified by the {Controller}[`@Controller`]
annotation, and the `GreetingController` shown in the following listing (from
`src/main/java/com/example/restservicecors/GreetingController.java`) handles `GET`
requests for `/greeting` by returning a new instance of the `Greeting` class:

====
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/com/example/restservicecors/GreetingController.java[lines=1..15;17..22;29..30]
----
====

This controller is concise and simple, but there is plenty going on under the hood. We
break it down step by step.

The `@RequestMapping` annotation ensures that HTTP requests to `/greeting` are mapped to the `greeting()` method.

NOTE: The preceding example uses the `@GetMapping` annotation, which acts as a shortcut
for `@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET)`.

`@RequestParam` binds the value of the `name` query string parameter into the `name`
parameter of the `greeting()` method. This query string parameter is not `required`. If it
is absent in the request, the `defaultValue` of `World` is used.

The implementation of the method body creates and returns a new `Greeting` object, with
the value of the `id` attribute based on the next value from the `counter` and the value
of the `content` based on the query parameter or the default value. It also formats the
given `name` by using the greeting `template`.

A key difference between a traditional MVC controller and the RESTful web service
controller shown earlier is the way that the HTTP response body is created. Rather than
relying on a view technology to perform server-side rendering of the greeting data to
HTML, this RESTful web service controller populates and returns a `Greeting` object. The
object data is written directly to the HTTP response as JSON.

To accomplish this, the {ResponseBody}[`@ResponseBody`] annotation on the `greeting()`
method tells Spring MVC that it does not need to render the greeting object through a
server-side view layer. Instead, the returned greeting object is the response body and
should be written out directly.

The `Greeting` object must be converted to JSON. Thanks to Spring's HTTP message converter
support, you need not do this conversion manually. Because {jackson}[Jackson] is on the
classpath, Spring's
{MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter}[`MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter`] is
automatically chosen to convert the `Greeting` instance to JSON.

== Enabling CORS

You can enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) from either in individual controllers or
globally. The following topics describe how to do so:

* <<controller-method-cors-configuration>>
* <<global-cors-configuration>>

[[controller-method-cors-configuration]]
=== Controller Method CORS Configuration

So that the RESTful web service will include CORS access control headers in its response,
you have to add a `@CrossOrigin` annotation to the handler method, as the following
listing (from `src/main/java/com/example/restservicecors/GreetingController.java`) shows:

====
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/com/example/restservicecors/GreetingController.java[lines=16..21]
----
====

This `@CrossOrigin` annotation enables cross-origin resource sharing only for this
specific method. By default, its allows all origins, all headers, and the HTTP methods
specified in the `@RequestMapping` annotation. Also, a `maxAge` of 30 minutes is used. You
can customize this behavior by specifying the value of one of the following annotation
attributes:

* `origins`
* `methods`
* `allowedHeaders`
* `exposedHeaders`
* `allowCredentials`
* `maxAge`.

In this example, we allow only `http://localhost:9000` to send cross-origin requests.

NOTE: You can also add the `@CrossOrigin` annotation at the controller class level as
well, to enable  CORS on all handler methods of this class.

[[global-cors-configuration]]
=== Global CORS configuration

In addition (or as an alternative) to fine-grained annotation-based configuration, you can
define some global CORS configuration as well. This is similar to using a `Filter` but can
be declared within Spring MVC and combined with fine-grained `@CrossOrigin` configuration.
By default, all origins and `GET`, `HEAD`, and `POST` methods are allowed.

The following listing (from
`src/main/java/com/example/restservicecors/GreetingController.java`) shows the
`greetingWithJavaconfig` method in the `GreetingController` class:

====
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/com/example/restservicecors/GreetingController.java[lines=23..27]
----
====

NOTE: The difference between the `greetingWithJavaconfig` method and the `greeting` method
(used in the <<controller-method-cors-configuration,controller-level CORS configuration>>)
is the route (`/greeting-javaconfig` rather than `/greeting`) and the presence of the
`@CrossOrigin` origin.

The following listing (from
`src/main/java/com/example/restservicecors/RestServiceCorsApplication.java`) shows how to
add CORS mapping in the application class:

====
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/com/example/restservicecors/RestServiceCorsApplication.java[lines=17..25]
----
====

You can easily change any properties (such as `allowedOrigins` in the example), as well as
apply this CORS configuration to a specific path pattern.

TIP: You can combine global- and controller-level CORS configuration.

== Creating the Application Class

The Spring Initializr creates a bare-bones application class for you. The following
listing (from
`initial/src/main/java/com/example/restservicecors/RestServiceCorsApplication.java`) shows
that initial class:

====
[source,java]
----
include::initial/src/main/java/com/example/restservicecors/RestServiceCorsApplication.java[]
----
====

You need to add a method to configure how to handle cross-origin resource sharing. The
following listing (from
`complete/src/main/java/com/example/restservicecors/RestServiceCorsApplication.java`)
shows how to do so:

====
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/com/example/restservicecors/RestServiceCorsApplication.java[lines=16..24]
----
====

The following listing shows the completed application class:

====
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/com/example/restservicecors/RestServiceCorsApplication.java[]
----
====

include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/master/spring-boot-application-new-path.adoc[]

include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/master/build_an_executable_jar_subhead.adoc[]

include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/master/build_an_executable_jar_with_both.adoc[]


Logging output is displayed. The service should be up and running within a few seconds.

== Test the service

Now that the service is up, visit `http://localhost:8080/greeting`, where you should see:

====
[source,json]
----
{"id":1,"content":"Hello, World!"}
----
====

Provide a `name` query string parameter by visiting
`http://localhost:8080/greeting?name=User`. The value of the `content` attribute changes
from `Hello, World!` to `Hello User!`, as the following listing shows:

====
[source,json]
----
{"id":2,"content":"Hello, User!"}
----
====

This change demonstrates that the `@RequestParam` arrangement in `GreetingController`
works as expected. The `name` parameter has been given a default value of `World` but can
always be explicitly overridden through the query string.

Also, the `id` attribute has changed from `1` to `2`. This proves that you are working
against the same `GreetingController` instance across multiple requests and that its
`counter` field is being incremented on each call, as expected.

Now you can test that the CORS headers are in place and allow a Javascript client from
another origin to access the service. To do so, you need to create a Javascript client to
consume the service. The following listing shows such a client:


First, create a simple Javascript file named `hello.js` (from `complete/public/hello.js`)
with the following content:

====
[source,js]
----
include::complete/public/hello.js[]
----
====

This script uses jQuery to consume the REST service at `http://localhost:8080/greeting`.
It is loaded by `index.html`, as the following listing (from `complete/public/index.html`)
shows:

====
[source,html]
----
include::complete/public/index.html[]
----
====

NOTE: This is essentially the REST client created in
{gs-consuming-rest-jquery}[Consuming a RESTful Web Service with jQuery], modified slightly
to consume the service when it runs on localhost at port 8080. See that guide for more
details on how this client was developed.

Because the REST service is already running on localhost at port 8080, you need to be sure
to start the client from another server or port. Doing so not only avoids a collision
between the two applications but also ensures that the client code is served from a
different origin than the service. To start the client running on localhost at port 9000,
run the following Maven command:

====
[source,bash]
----
./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dserver.port=9000
----
====

If you use Gradle, you can append the following snippet to build.gradle
====
[source,text]
----
bootRun{
	systemProperty 'server.port', '9000'
}
----
====
Then run the following Gradle command:
[source,bash]
----
./gradlew bootRun -Dserver.port=9000
----
====

Once the client starts, open http://localhost:9000 in your browser, where you should see
the following:

image::images/hello.png[Model data retrieved from the REST service is rendered into the DOM if the proper CORS headers are in the response.]

If the service response includes the CORS headers, then the ID and content are rendered
into the page. But if the CORS headers are missing (or insufficiently defined for the
client), the browser fails the request and the values are not rendered into the DOM. In
that case, you should see the following:

image::images/hello_fail.png[The browser will fail the request if the CORS headers are missing from the response. No data will be rendered into the DOM.]


== Summary

Congratulations! You have just developed a RESTful web service that includes Cross-Origin
Resource Sharing with Spring.
