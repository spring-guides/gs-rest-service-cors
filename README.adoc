This guide walks you through the process of creating a "`Hello, World`" RESTful web
service with Spring that includes headers for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in the
response. You can find more information about Spring CORS support in this
link:/blog/2015/06/08/cors-support-in-spring-framework[blog post].

== What You Will Build

You will build a service that accepts HTTP GET requests at
`http://localhost:8080/greeting` and responds with a JSON representation of a greeting, as
the following listing shows:

====
[source,json]
----
{"id":1,"content":"Hello, World!"}
----
====

You can customize the greeting with an optional `name` parameter in the query string, as
the following listing shows:

====
[source,text]
----
http://localhost:8080/greeting?name=User
----
====

The `name` parameter value overrides the default value of `World` and is reflected in the
response, as the following listing shows:

====
[source,json]
----
{"id":1,"content":"Hello, User!"}
----
====

This service differs slightly from the one described in
{gs-rest-service}[Building a RESTful Web Service], in that it uses Spring Framework CORS
support to add the relevant CORS response headers.

== Starting with Spring Initializr

You can use this https://start.spring.io/#!type=maven-project&groupId=com.example&artifactId=rest-service-cors&name=rest-service-cors&description=Demo%20project%20for%20Spring%20Boot&packageName=com.example.rest-service-cors&dependencies=web[pre-initialized project] and click Generate to download a ZIP file. This project is configured to fit the examples in this tutorial.

To manually initialize the project:

. Navigate to https://start.spring.io.
This service pulls in all the dependencies you need for an application and does most of the setup for you.
. Choose either Gradle or Maven and the language you want to use. This guide assumes that you chose Java.
. Click *Dependencies* and select *Spring Web*.
. Click *Generate*.
. Download the resulting ZIP file, which is an archive of a web application that is configured with your choices.

NOTE: If your IDE has the Spring Initializr integration, you can complete this process from your IDE.

NOTE: You can also fork the project from Github and open it in your IDE or other editor.

=== Adding the `httpclient5` Dependency

The tests (in
`complete/src/test/java/com/example/restservicecors/GreetingIntegrationTests.java`)
require the Apache `httpclient5` library.

To add the Apache `httpclient5` library to Maven, add the following dependency:

====
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.httpcomponents.client5</groupId>
  <artifactId>httpclient5</artifactId>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----
====

The following listing shows the finished `pom.xml` file:

====
[source,xml]
----
include::complete/pom.xml[]
----
====

To add the Apache `httpclient5` library to Gradle, add the following dependency:

====
[source,text]
----
testImplementation 'org.apache.httpcomponents.client5:httpclient5'
----
====

The following listing shows the finished `build.gradle` file:

====
[source,xml]
----
include::complete/build.gradle[]
----

== Create a Resource Representation Class

Now that you have set up the project and build system, you can create your web service.

Begin the process by thinking about service interactions.

The service will handle `GET` requests to `/greeting`, optionally with a `name` parameter
in the query string. The `GET` request should return a `200 OK` response with JSON in the
body to represent a greeting. It should resemble the following listing:

====
[source,json]
----
{
    "id": 1,
    "content": "Hello, World!"
}
----
====

The `id` field is a unique identifier for the greeting, and `content` is the textual
representation of the greeting.

To model the greeting representation, create a resource representation class. Provide a
plain old Java object with fields, constructors, and accessors for the `id` and `content`
data, as the following listing (from
  `src/main/java/com/example/restservicecors/Greeting.java`) shows:

====
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/com/example/restservicecors/Greeting.java[]
----
====

NOTE: Spring uses the {jackson}[Jackson JSON] library to automatically marshal instances
of type `Greeting` into JSON.

== Create a Resource Controller

In Spring's approach to building RESTful web services, HTTP requests are handled by a
controller. These components are easily identified by the {Controller}[`@Controller`]
annotation, and the `GreetingController` shown in the following listing (from
`src/main/java/com/example/restservicecors/GreetingController.java`) handles `GET`
requests for `/greeting` by returning a new instance of the `Greeting` class:

====
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/com/example/restservicecors/GreetingController.java[lines=1..15;17..22;29..30]
----
====

This controller is concise and simple, but there is plenty going on under the hood. We
break it down step by step.

The `@RequestMapping` annotation ensures that HTTP requests to `/greeting` are mapped to the `greeting()` method.

NOTE: The preceding example uses the `@GetMapping` annotation, which acts as a shortcut
for `@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET)`. We use `GET` in this case because it is convenient for testing.
Spring will still reject a GET request where the origin doesn't match the CORS configuration.
The browser is not required to send a CORS preflight request, but we could use `@PostMapping` and accept some JSON in the body if we wanted to trigger a pre-flight check.

`@RequestParam` binds the value of the `name` query string parameter into the `name`
parameter of the `greeting()` method. This query string parameter is not `required`. If it
is absent in the request, the `defaultValue` of `World` is used.

The implementation of the method body creates and returns a new `Greeting` object, with
the value of the `id` attribute based on the next value from the `counter` and the value
of the `content` based on the query parameter or the default value. It also formats the
given `name` by using the greeting `template`.

A key difference between a traditional MVC controller and the RESTful web service
controller shown earlier is the way that the HTTP response body is created. Rather than
relying on a view technology to perform server-side rendering of the greeting data to
HTML, this RESTful web service controller populates and returns a `Greeting` object. The
object data is written directly to the HTTP response as JSON.

To accomplish this, the {RestController}[`@RestController`] annotation
assumes that every method inherits the {ResponseBody}[`@ResponseBody`] semantics by default.
Therefore, a returned object data is inserted directly into the response body.

Thanks to Spring's HTTP message converter support, the `Greeting` object is naturally converted to JSON.
Because {jackson}[Jackson] is on the classpath, Spring's
{MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter}[`MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter`] is
automatically chosen to convert the `Greeting` instance to JSON.

== Enabling CORS

You can enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) from either in individual controllers or
globally. The following topics describe how to do so:

* <<controller-method-cors-configuration>>
* <<global-cors-configuration>>

[[controller-method-cors-configuration]]
=== Controller Method CORS Configuration

So that the RESTful web service will include CORS access control headers in its response,
you have to add a `@CrossOrigin` annotation to the handler method, as the following
listing (from `src/main/java/com/example/restservicecors/GreetingController.java`) shows:

====
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/com/example/restservicecors/GreetingController.java[lines=16..21]
----
====

This `@CrossOrigin` annotation enables cross-origin resource sharing only for this
specific method. By default, its allows all origins, all headers, and the HTTP methods
specified in the `@RequestMapping` annotation. Also, a `maxAge` of 30 minutes is used. You
can customize this behavior by specifying the value of one of the following annotation
attributes:

* `origins`
* `originPatterns`
* `methods`
* `allowedHeaders`
* `exposedHeaders`
* `allowCredentials`
* `maxAge`.

In this example, we allow only `http://localhost:9000` to send cross-origin requests.

NOTE: You can also add the `@CrossOrigin` annotation at the controller class level as
well, to enable CORS on all handler methods of this class.

[[global-cors-configuration]]
=== Global CORS configuration

In addition (or as an alternative) to fine-grained annotation-based configuration, you can
define some global CORS configuration as well. This is similar to using a `Filter` but can
be declared within Spring MVC and combined with fine-grained `@CrossOrigin` configuration.
By default, all origins and `GET`, `HEAD`, and `POST` methods are allowed.

The following listing (from
`src/main/java/com/example/restservicecors/GreetingController.java`) shows the
`greetingWithJavaconfig` method in the `GreetingController` class:

====
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/com/example/restservicecors/GreetingController.java[lines=23..27]
----
====

NOTE: The difference between the `greetingWithJavaconfig` method and the `greeting` method
(used in the <<controller-method-cors-configuration,controller-level CORS configuration>>)
is the route (`/greeting-javaconfig` rather than `/greeting`) and the presence of the
`@CrossOrigin` origin.

The following listing (from
`src/main/java/com/example/restservicecors/RestServiceCorsApplication.java`) shows how to
add CORS mapping in the application class:

====
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/com/example/restservicecors/RestServiceCorsApplication.java[lines=17..25]
----
====

You can easily change any properties (such as `allowedOrigins` in the example), as well as
apply this CORS configuration to a specific path pattern.

TIP: You can combine global- and controller-level CORS configuration.

== Creating the Application Class

The Spring Initializr creates a bare-bones application class for you. The following
listing (from
`initial/src/main/java/com/example/restservicecors/RestServiceCorsApplication.java`) shows
that initial class:

====
[source,java]
----
include::initial/src/main/java/com/example/restservicecors/RestServiceCorsApplication.java[]
----
====

You need to add a method to configure how to handle cross-origin resource sharing. The
following listing (from
`complete/src/main/java/com/example/restservicecors/RestServiceCorsApplication.java`)
shows how to do so:

====
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/com/example/restservicecors/RestServiceCorsApplication.java[lines=16..24]
----
====

The following listing shows the completed application class:

====
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/com/example/restservicecors/RestServiceCorsApplication.java[]
----
====

include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/main/spring-boot-application-new-path.adoc[]

include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/main/build_an_executable_jar_subhead.adoc[]

include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/main/build_an_executable_jar_with_both.adoc[]


Logging output is displayed. The service should be up and running within a few seconds.

== Test the service

Now that the service is up, visit `http://localhost:8080/greeting` in your browser where you should see:

====
[source,json]
----
{"id":1,"content":"Hello, World!"}
----
====

Provide a `name` query string parameter by visiting
`http://localhost:8080/greeting?name=User`. The value of the `content` attribute changes
from `Hello, World!` to `Hello User!`, as the following listing shows:

====
[source,json]
----
{"id":2,"content":"Hello, User!"}
----
====

This change demonstrates that the `@RequestParam` arrangement in `GreetingController`
works as expected. The `name` parameter has been given a default value of `World` but can
always be explicitly overridden through the query string.

Also, the `id` attribute has changed from `1` to `2`. This proves that you are working
against the same `GreetingController` instance across multiple requests and that its
`counter` field is being incremented on each call, as expected.

Now you can test that the CORS headers are in place and allow a Javascript client from
another origin to access the service. To do so, you need to create a Javascript client to
consume the service. The following listing shows such a client:


First, create a simple Javascript file named `hello.js` (from `complete/public/hello.js`)
with the following content:

====
[source,js]
----
include::complete/public/hello.js[]
----
====

This script uses jQuery to consume the REST service at `http://localhost:8080/greeting`.
It is loaded by `index.html`, as the following listing (from `complete/public/index.html`)
shows:

====
[source,html]
----
include::complete/public/index.html[]
----
====

To test the CORS behaviour, you need to start the client from another server or port.
Doing so not only avoids a collision between the two applications, but also ensures that the client code is served from a
different origin than the service.

To start the client running on localhost at port 9000, keep the application running at port 8080 and
run the following Maven command in another terminal:

====
[source,bash]
----
./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.jvmArguments='-Dserver.port=9000'
----
====

If you use Gradle, you can use this command:
====
[source,text]
----
./gradlew bootRun --args="--server.port=9000"
----
====

Once the app starts, open http://localhost:9000 in your browser, where you should see
the following because the service response includes the relevant CORS headers, so the ID and content are rendered into
the page:

image::{images}/hello.png[Model data retrieved from the REST service is rendered into the DOM if the proper CORS headers are in the response.]

Now, stop the application running at port 9000, keep the application running at port 8080 and run the following Maven
command in another terminal:

====
[source,bash]
----
./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.jvmArguments='-Dserver.port=9001'
----
====

If you use Gradle, you can use this command:
====
[source,text]
----
./gradlew bootRun --args="--server.port=9001"
----
====

Once the app starts, open http://localhost:9001 in your browser, where you should see
the following:

image::{images}/hello_fail.png[The browser will fail the request if the CORS headers are missing (or insufficient for theclient) from the response. No data will be rendered into the DOM.]

Here, the browser fails the request and the values are not rendered into the DOM because the CORS headers are missing
(or insufficient for the client), since we only allowed cross-origin requests from http://localhost:9000, not
http://localhost:9001.
